          <h4 class="style2">The Contract Between Us</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Any contract for purchases made through the web site will be with  eM&amp;M Limited, registered in Sydney, and whose registered  office is Media House company registration number 43585.</li>
            <li>eM&amp;M must receive payment of the whole of the price for the goods  that you order before your order can be accepted, and the contract  formed. Payment is not taken until the point of despatch of the goods  to you from our premises in Sydney. When payment is to be made with  E-Vouchers, the E-voucher will be removed from your wallet on placing  your order but will not be accepted as payment until the goods are  despatched to you. If the order is cancelled or not fulfilled the  E-Voucher will be re-credited to your wallet. Once payment has been  received eM&amp;M will confirm that your order has been received by sending  an email to you at the email address you provide in your registration  form. The shipment email will include your name, the order number and  the total price. eM&amp;M s acceptance of your order brings into existence a  legally binding contract between us on these terms. Any term sought to  be imposed by you in your order will not form part of the contract.</li>
            <li>eM&amp;M are entitled to withdraw from any contract in the case of  obvious errors or inaccuracies regarding the goods appearing on our web  site. If an error or inaccuracy is discovered with regards to the  advertised price of the goods that you have ordered before the contract  is made (see (b) above) we will contact you as soon as possible by  email. </li>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h4 class="style2">Withdrawal By You From The Contract</h4>
          <p>If you are an individual and are not buying goods on behalf of a  business, there are certain circumstances in which you may withdraw  from the contract and these are set out here. This right to withdraw  does not apply to business buyers.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>You may withdraw your order for goods at any time up to the end of  the twenty first working day after you have received the goods. You do  not need to give eM&amp;M any reason for withdrawing your order nor will you  have to pay any penalty.</li>
            <li>The only circumstances in which you cannot withdraw your order are  where you have taken the goods you have ordered (or the ones in  relation to which you want to withdraw) out of the sealed package in  which they were delivered.</li>
            <li>To withdraw your order you must notify eM&amp;M in writing at the address set out in the eM&amp;M returns section of this Web site.</li>
            <li>If you have received the goods before you withdraw your order then,  unless you have lost your right to withdraw because you have taken the  goods out of their sealed package, you must send them back to the eM&amp;M  contact address at your own cost and risk. If you withdraw your order  but eM&amp;M has already processed the goods for delivery and you have  received them, you must not unpack the goods when they are received by  you and you must send the goods back toeM&amp;M at the eM&amp;M contact address  at your own cost and risk as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>Once you have notified eM&amp;M that you are withdrawing your order, any  sum debited to eM&amp;M from your credit card will be re-credited to your  account as soon as possible and in any event within 30 days of your  order PROVIDED THAT the goods in question are returned by you and  received by eM&amp;M in the condition they were in when delivered to you.</li>

            <li>eM&amp;M will post, or arrange a courier on your behalf for, the goods  ordered by you to the person and address you give eM&amp;M at the time you  make your order. The consignee (i.e. the person to whom the consignment  is sent) will be the declarant and importer into the country for which  the consignment is destined. For non-Sydney destinations, the consignee  will be responsible for both customs clearance and payment of customs  duties and local taxes where required. Each item ordered will be  treated as a seperate sale and will be shipped and paid for seperately. </li>
            <li>Delivery will be made as soon as possible after your order is  accepted and in any event within 30 days of despatch of the order. All  delivery times quoted on the web site are estimates only, based on  availability, normal processing and delivery companies.</li>
